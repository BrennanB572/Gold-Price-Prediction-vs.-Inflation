Project Description/Outline
-	Compare against different currencies of other nations < Against Inflation
o	USA
o	EURO
o	RUBLE
o	YEN


 Research Questions to Answer
Where is the money lowest inflation?
What currency experience the highest inflation?
What currency experience the lowest inflation?
Is it profitable to move money?
What currency has the consistent value range for the longest time?
What currency has the least consistent value range for the longest time?


Datasets to Be Used:
Gold Prices:
Gold Price Prediction | LSTM | 96% Accuracy
Inflation Rates:
EU
European Union | Data (worldbank.org)
USA
United States | Data (worldbank.org) 
China
China | Data (worldbank.org) 
Russia
Russian Federation | Data (worldbank.org)

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1 - Complete exports for inflation rates:
USA
EUROPE
RUSSIA
CHINA

2 - Complete Export for Gold prices:
Gold Price Prediction | LSTM | 96% Accuracy

3 - Format CSV Files
Format CSV Files to make it easier to pull using pandas

4 - File Organization
	Come together to ensure all resources files such as CSVs are being stored in one place

5 – Join Years Available 
	Trim excess years from both files so that both files have the shared time.

6 – Gold File Updated to annual averages
	Create code to swap data from monthly to annual amounts.


7 – Create Currency Specific Gold Valuation 
USA – 2steps under each
EU – 2steps under each
RUSSIA – 2steps under each
CHINA – 2steps under each


8 – Scatter Plot: (Create a comparison of the gold and currency inflation rate.)
USA – 	
    Price on Y axis
	Time on X Axis
    ??? on z axis
	
9 – Chart Presentation (In Jupyter)
	Proper Labels and Formatting
